# JobMatching

<p>The matching criteria is that split the skills into a string list for both jobs and candidates. For a certain job use the skills list to intersect with each candidateï¿½s skill list. The one who has the max count of intersection is the candidate we are looking for.</p>

<p>The following code show the core logic to find the most matched candidate.</P>

<code>var mostMatchedCandidate = candidates.MaxBy(x => x.Skill_Tag.Intersect(job.Skill_Tag).Count()); </code>




<h2>Debug in your local</h2>

<p>Download the repository to your local, open JobMatching.sln using Visual studio 2022 and run </p>


<p>After that open the folder JobMatchingWeb using vs code and in the terminal type 'npm start' to run the angular app. </p>




<h2>Live Demo</h2>

<p>You can also find the live demo which has been deployed to Azure.
https://jobmatchingweb.azurewebsites.net. </p>
<p>It will take a while to show the list for the first time because I am using a Free/shared app service.</p>
